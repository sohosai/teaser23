Sopotan, the official mascot of Sohosai, made a controversial post(tweet).

Sopotan posted on X(formerly Twitter) on July 3: "今日はつくば山で遊ぶそぽ！ そぽたんにはテストなんかないそぽ～"(I gonna play at Mt.Tsukuba today! There are no exams for me.)
Many students had worked hard for exams of Spring C Term. Therefore, several people reacted like: "I'm about to snap.", "I never forgive them."
